TODO: add any details

Uses OpenSim 4.4 with Python 3.10

- Test idea of developing model outputs in `Model.cpp` & `Model.h`
- Simulate this by creating model outputs in CPP/Python code by defining functions with similar inputs
  - Create a function that would take in state and other inputs
  - Run function with a state
  - Grab vector outputs and mess with these
- Use some sample states from MocoTrajectory files â€” output ZMP ground reactions printed to screen just to check that the function is outputting stuff correctly
