> Probe implementation not really used in OpenSim anymore. Consider developing approach as an output of the model instead
	>> Output examples: energy of model, centre of mass location, potential energy, linear momentum etc.
	>> Outputs are available to all tools, hence it seems appropriate to use
	>> Determine all inputs/outputs for the component etc.
	
> How to apply forces back onto model?
	>> Essentially replace GRFs in any simulations

> MocoGoal?
	>> ContactTracking may be best exemplar
		
> Setting up own OpenSim environment to tinker with changes is a good idea

> Different results from Moco trajectory?
	>> Prescribed motion aspect of Moco may be causing difference?
