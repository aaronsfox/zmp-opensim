# Datasets

All datasets included in this folder are available open-source. Details on each dataset and how to download/access are included in the relevant folders. To reduce repo size, the raw data may not be included — but README files will include appropriate instructions on how to download the data and extract using any relevant code.

Datasets are labelled in a manner that describes the participant cohort, movement and setting — followed by a named description of the dataset. For example:

- human-running-treadmill_HamnerDelp2013 refers to a dataset of humans running on a treadmill from the paper by Hamner & Delp in 2013 (*pretty self-explanatory, hey!*)

A brief introduction to the datasets can be found below.
