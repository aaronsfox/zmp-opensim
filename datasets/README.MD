# Datasets

All datasets included in this folder are available open-source. Details on each dataset and how to download/access are included in the relevant folders. To reduce repo size, the raw data may not be included â€” but README files will include appropriate instructions on how to download the data and extract using any relevant code. Datasets are labelled below in a manner that describes the participant cohort, movement and setting. 

Category descriptors are fairly self-explanatory:

**Participant Cohort**

- *Human*: Healthy human participants
- *Avian*: Presumably healthy bird species

**Movement**

- *Walking*: Walking movement, characterised by period of double support
- *Running*: Running movement, characterised by absence of double support and presence of flight phase
- *Gait*: Includes both walking and running movements

**Setting**

- *Overground*: Movement performed on flat, overground surface
- *Treadmill*: Movement performed on a motorised treadmill

A brief introduction to the datasets can be found below.
